- 🔭 I’m currently working on #WordPress block themes. The goal is to create multiple starter themes for small businesses.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud development and cloud infrastructure. I am curious: ``How can small businesses take advantage of cloud infrastructure to achieve their goals at affordable prices?`` Currently, I am learning the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source and community-oriented projects. _*If there is an opportunity to contribute, I am open to collaborating on making cool stuff that helps others.*_
