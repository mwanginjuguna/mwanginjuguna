- I am currently working on building PHP web applications for small businesses.
- I am learning cloud development and cloud infrastructure with a specific challenge in mind: ``How can small businesses in Africa and third-world countries take advantage of cloud infrastructure to achieve their goals at affordable prices?``
- I am open to collaborating on open-source and community-oriented projects - _If there is an opportunity to contribute, I am open to collaborating on making cool stuff that helps others._
- Let's chat about any of these: Teaching, Programming, Science, People, PHP, deep learning, small businesses, African heritage and culture, Reggae music, cycling, and your favorites too.
- I greatly enjoy the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman) due to its diverse topics, especially on Tech, Science, and AI.
