## Technologies

I use: 
* PHP, Laravel, Livewire, and Javascript frameworks to build websites and web applications.
* Python to create automation scripts e.g. _Web Scrapping, jupiter Notebooks, Server Automation Scripts, Data Analytics, etc_
* SQL & MySQL for Database operations
* Git & Github for version control
* Google Cloud Platform, & DigitalOcean for deployment
* Ubuntu for server administration

I am exploring Neural Networks and Deep Learning to understand the technology driving AI through communities, models, datasets, platforms, and libraries such as **Pytorch**, _[kaggle.com notebooks and competitions](https://kaggle.com/mkanothe/notebooks)/Colab_, and fastai.

As a Creator, I sell Websites, web applications, and landing page copies at [mwangikanothe.com](https://mwangikanothe.com/shop).
<br>
I founded Paper Study Service (2019 - 2023), to provide tools and services that help students with academic research, writing, and private tutoring.

I am passionate about writing and I host a blog at my website ([mwangikanothe.com/blog](https://mwangikanothe.com/blog)). I use writing as a tool to communicate complex and technical concepts into simple, actionable, and practical knowledge for everyday people.

I believe technology provides the greatest opportunity for communities to accelerate sustainable growth, set ambitious goals, and achieve great levels of growth. I hope to contribute towards such impactful use of technology among individuals and businesses.
