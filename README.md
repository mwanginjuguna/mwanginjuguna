## Technologies

I use: 
* PHP _(specifically, Laravel_) and Javascript frameworks _(jQuery | Vue.js | React.js)_ to create websites and web applications.
* React-Native and Flutter for Mobile Applications.
* Python and C++ for business software e.g. _Web Scrapping, jupiter Notebooks, Server Automation Scripts, Data Analytics, etc_
* SQL & MySQL for Database operations
* Git & Github for version control
* Google Cloud Platform, AWS, & DigitalOcean for deployment

I am exploring Deep Learning to understand the technology driving AI through communities, models, datasets, platforms, and libraries such as **Pytorch**, _[kaggle.com notebooks and competitions](https://kaggle.com/mkanothe/notebooks)/Colab_, and fastai.

As an enterpreneur, I sell Websites, web applications, and landing page sripts at [mwangikanothe.com](https://mwangikanothe.com/).
<br>
I also founded Paper Study, which provides tools and services that help students excell in their academic research and writing practices.

I am passionate about writing and I host a blog at my website ([mwangikanothe.com/blog](https://mwangikanothe.com/blog)). I use the blog as a knowledge sharing platform, with the hope to encourage people to use technology to develop communities, especially in the developing countries.

I believe technology provides the greatest opportunity for communities to accelerate sustainable growth and achieve prosperity.
