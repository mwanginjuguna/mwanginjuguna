# I am Francis Njuguna (Mwangi Kanothe).

**I am passionate about TWO things: Building Software and Writing about stuff**.

> - I build software for web and businesses. These include web applications, landing pages, websites, mobile apps, and automation scripts.
> - I am a passionate writer and educator. I write blogs, technical guides, tutorials, and web content to teach and explain complex topics, breaking them down to bit-size actionable stuff.
